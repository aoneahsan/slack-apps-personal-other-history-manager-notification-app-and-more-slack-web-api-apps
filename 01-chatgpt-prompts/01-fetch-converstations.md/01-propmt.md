i'm creating a slack history manager app, so what i want is a app, which will send request to slack api with workspace token, fetch all it's conversations and all it's data, users, chats, messages, files, all, and store that in json files in folder basd on date time when it was fetched locally, this is so i will be able to have full record of my conversations, chats, files, users and all from slack locally in json files and will be able to use them later when needed, the workspace is mine, the app is mine so i can ask for any permission etc any thing which i need to get the job done.

write api to fetch conversations store that locally in json, in date time based folder inside, saved-data folder, then get messages, files and all data from each and every conversation, store that with proper structure in respective folder and continue this process until i have downloaded and stored all the data from slack from my workspace
